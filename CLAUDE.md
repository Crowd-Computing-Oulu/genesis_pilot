## EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Scientific Rigour

Never produce hand-wavy, theoretically indefensible claims. This is a scientific project targeting a HCOMP 2026 full paper, with an ERC Consolidator grant proposal as broader context. Every design choice, every mechanism, every causal claim must be theoretically grounded and defensible. If something cannot be justified rigorously, say so. If you are unsure whether a claim holds, flag it as uncertain rather than presenting it as fact. Simo is a professor and CHI subcommittee chair; do not waste his time with nonsense.

## Project Overview

ATLAS Pilot is a three-condition between-subjects online experiment (target N≥300) that takes a first empirical step toward measuring how everyday self-care practices can be reliably elicited and structured in a human-AI partnership. The study targets **HCOMP 2026 (full paper, archival)** and produces a v0.1 seed practice atlas for stress and anxiety coping.

The pilot is independent of the ATLAS proposal's planned cross-cultural N≈1000 study. The proposal lives at `~/Documents/Academic/Proposals/ATLAS` (see `CLAUDE.local.md` for paths and venue context).

### Locked design

The locked design is in `docs/study_design_memo.md`. The internal date-stamped analysis plan is in `docs/analysis_plan_v1.md`. **No public OSF pre-registration.**

### Terminology

- **Primitive:** a single typed value on one dimension. Three primitive types: Technique (T), Dosage (D), Mode (M).
- **Practice:** a triple ⟨T, D, M⟩.
- **Practice report:** practice + context + outcome (raw participant submission).

Pilot artefacts use these terms consistently. Earlier drafts used "behavioural gene" for what is now "practice"; that terminology has been retired from paper-facing artefacts.

### Conditions

- **Condition 1 (Pure baseline):** Free text, no hints, no AI. Tests at what specificity level people naturally encode T/D/M.
- **Condition 2 (Textual nudge):** Free text with verbal hints toward "what you do, how much, in what way." No AI. Tests whether minimal prompting increases specificity.
- **Condition 3 (AI coach):** Free text (same prompt as C1), then up to 2 rounds of iterative AI dialogue with a confirmation gate after each AI extraction. Participant can exit at round 0 if the extraction looks accurate. RoundsTaken ∈ {0, 1, 2} is itself a primary variable of interest.

**Key difference:** Conditions 1-2 have NO AI interaction during the study. Only Condition 3 involves live AI. **Specificity coding for ALL conditions is done post-hoc by Prolific raters** (with rubric pilot to achieve kappa ≥ 0.6), not by the LLM. Canonical-technique clustering for the atlas is done expert-style by Hosio + 1 coauthor.

### Domain

All participants describe a practice they use **specifically when feeling stressed or anxious**, not as part of their general routine. PSS-4 (Cohen & Williamson 1988) administered at intake for sample characterisation only.

### Study Flow (as currently implemented in app; some locked-design changes still pending in code, see Implementation TODOs below)

1. Consent + eligibility (+ PSS-4: TODO)
2. Practice description (condition-specific prompt)
3. [Condition 3 only] AI coach refinement, max 2 rounds with confirmation gate (gate: TODO)
4. Fidelity check: C1/C2 see their raw text back; C3 sees structured practice
5. Context + outcome (exploratory practice-report fields)
6. Questionnaire (willingness, interest, feedback)
7. Debrief + completion code

### Key Measurement: Specificity per Dimension

Each dimension (T, D, M) is coded on a 0-3 specificity scale (absent → category → named → parameterised), grounded in TIDieR (Hoffmann 2014) and the Michie ontologies (Michie 2013, Marques 2024). Sum specificity = T+D+M (0-9), reported as a descriptive composite only. The earlier "computability threshold" of ≥6 is dropped from the pilot's analysis.

### Dataset Contribution: Seed Practice Atlas (v0.1)

Released on Zenodo/OSF with the paper. Canonical-technique clustering done expert-style by Hosio + 1 coauthor using BCTO merge/split criteria (Marques et al., 2024). Not crowd-codable work.

## Implementation TODOs from the locked design

The app and supporting docs still need updates to match the locked design. None are technically blocking but all should ship before Prolific launch:

- `app/steps/input.php`: update C1 and C2 prompt text to include "specifically when you are feeling stressed or anxious".
- `app/steps/consent.php`: update eligibility text; add PSS-4 either at end of consent or as a new step before input.
- `app/steps/refinement.php`: add confirmation gate after each AI extraction (Yes-exit / No-refine). Hard cap at 2 refinement rounds. Track RoundsTaken in DB.
- `app/llm.php`: update system prompt to use "practice" / "primitive" terminology rather than "behavioural gene".
- (Optional cleanup) Internal variable names (`$gene` → `$practice`), CSS class names (`.gene-card` → `.practice-card`), DB column comments. Schema (`gene_extractions` table) can stay; not user-facing.
- `paper/paper.tex`: switch venue declaration from CHI '27 to HCOMP '26 and `acmart` document class option from `manuscript` to `sigconf`.

Note on internal naming: the database table `gene_extractions` and some PHP variables / CSS classes (`$gene`, `.gene-card`) retain the older terminology. They are not user-facing and have been left alone to avoid schema migrations during active development. Renaming is optional cleanup.
